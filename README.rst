=====================
JK2 SDK GPL - Vanilla
=====================

This is an alternative *Star Wars Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast* 1.04
SDK released under the GPLv2 license. Search for *JK2 Editing Tools
2.0* if wish to get familiar with original SDK released by Raven in
2003, containing also tools and guides for creating maps, models,
effects, scripts and other modifications.

Creating this repository was made possible thanks to Raven releasing
JK2 source code in 2013. Vanilla branch contains almost unaltered
subset of it necessary for creating code mods, with just a few
critical bug fixes. Check out a master branch of this repository if
you're interested in starting a new project.

Build
=====

Linux
-----

You will need GNU Make and GCC or Clang compiler. Type ``make`` to
build .so files in base/ and .qvm files in base/vm/ You can add
``-jN`` option to speed up the build process by running N jobs
simultaneously. Type ``make help`` to learn about other targets.

Assume your mod is called "mymod" and your main JK2 directory is
~/.jkii In order to test the mod, put .qvm files in ~/.jkii/mymod/vm/
and launch the game with ``+set fs_game mymod`` commandline parameter.

To debug your mod use generated .so files. Put them in ~/.jkii/mymod/
and launch the game with ``+set vm_game 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_ui
0`` commandline parameters. Set them back to 2 when you want to use
.qvm version again.

Windows
-------

Currently there is no support for building shared libraries on
Windows. Old ``code/buildvms.bat`` batch file should work for QVMs if
you can get lcc and q3asm tools (eg from *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0*) and
put them into bin/ directory.

I'll be glad to include Windows build scripts, project files etc. if
you can create and test them.

------

Did you know that, compared to *JK2 Editing Tools 2.0* license, GPLv2
doesn't prohibit you from:

* Distributing your mod by means other than internet and even charging
  for it.

* Creating mods which infringe against third party rights, are
  libelous, defamatory, obscene, false, misleading and otherwise
  illegal and unlawful.

* Shipping them to countries to which the U.S. has embargoed goods and
  to people who are prohibited by applicable law from receiving it.
